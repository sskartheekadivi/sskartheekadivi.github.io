# Introduction
Hello there, I'm Kartheek. An ambivert & happy soul in & as an embedded software engineer based in Bengaluru.

> I was an introvert throughout my childhood and has been an ambivert ever since I started working. It was a fun transition.
{: .prompt-tip }

# Background
Throughout my career, I have gained expertise in Firmware and Driver development, BootROM, Yocto and have experience working with a variety of tools and technologies, including FreeRTOS, Linux Kernel, OpemEmbedded Yocto Project. I am always eager to learn and try something new stepping out of my comfort zone.

> Despite the fact that I just did my 3 year Diploma (Polytechnic) by the time I started my Career, I have always believed that I can become what I am now without an actual Degree.
