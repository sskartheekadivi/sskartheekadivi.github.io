# Introduction
Hello there, I'm Kartheek. An ambivert & happy soul in & as an embedded software engineer based in Bengaluru.
I'm from Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh. A coastal area with finger-licking spicy food and super hot summers.

I love listening to music, going on bike rides and talking to people. So I'm trying to learn music, repair my bike and becoming an extrovert.
I cook and I like my food. (That doesn't mean it tastes good. &#128540;)

I believe in manifestation and positive thinking (despite the fact that I do get negative thoughts). I live by the following simple principles ..
* Smile and let smile
* Do it coz you like it
* Less is more

> I was an introvert throughout my childhood and has been an ambivert ever since I started working. It was a fun transition.

# Background
Throughout my career, I have gained expertise in Firmware and Driver development, BootROM, Yocto and have experience working with a variety of tools and technologies, including FreeRTOS, Linux Kernel, OpemEmbedded Yocto Project and Debian. I am always eager to learn and try something new stepping out of my comfort zone.

> Despite the fact that I just did my 3 year Diploma (Polytechnic) by the time I started my Career, I have always believed that I can become what I am now without an actual Degree.
